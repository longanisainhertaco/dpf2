# Benchmarks

The `benchmarks/` directory contains small regression problems with known
analytic solutions.  They are intended both as examples of the simulation
infrastructure and as safeguards against code regression.  Each benchmark
compares model output to a reference solution from the literature.

## Analytic plasma expansion

`benchmarks/analytic_plasma_expansion.py` models the expansion of a
quasi-neutral plasma into vacuum using the isothermal approximation.  The ion
front position is

$$R(t) = R_0 + c_s t,$$

where $c_s$ is the ion sound speed.  See Spitzer (1962) and Dawson (1960) for
details.  Run the benchmark with

```bash
python -m benchmarks.analytic_plasma_expansion
```

## Bohm sheath formation

`benchmarks/bohm_sheath_benchmark.py` exercises the `BohmSheath` class and
verifies the expected sheath potential drop and Bohm velocity
(see Bohm 1949).  Execute with

```bash
python -m benchmarks.bohm_sheath_benchmark
```

## Continuous integration

The benchmark scripts can be incorporated into continuous integration as
long-running jobs or nightly builds.  The tests in `tests/test_benchmarks.py`
provide a lightweight example that can be enabled in CI pipelines.
